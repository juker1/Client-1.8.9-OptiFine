# Client-1.8.9-OptiFine
Decompiled Minecraft 1.8.9 with OptiFine 1.8.9 HD U L5, Has 2 - 4 errors which is the build path thing, Read "Errors" for the errors.

# How to get?
Go to releases, And there will be a release for the zip file of the decompiled version of 1.8.9 with optifine.

# Errors
Also 2-4 errors will appear, You need to configure the build path for the Client folder and find vecmath-1.5.2 with a different location and just remove that one and add the vecmath that you got in the lib folder to your libraries, Don't know how? here's how:

Right click Client, Build Path > Add External Archives, Select vecmath from the lib folder

that would fix 2 errors, and the other 2 errors are just the location to your 1.8.9 minecraft version
